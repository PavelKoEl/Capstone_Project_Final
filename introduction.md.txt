# Introduction
As a foreigner living and working in Taipei City of Taiwan, with a little knowledge of the Chinese language, sometimes I have problems to understand the city, locations, places and its people. With the power of Python, I will try to explore how places are located in this city.
## Method
- Get the location data
- Geocode it into coordiantes
- Use Foursquare to examine each neighborhood
- Cluster the neighborhood using KNN
I will make the attempt for restaurants only.

Target audience is anyone who likes to explore the city of Hangzhou, especially from the viewpoint of an alien with a little knowledge of language to communicate.
